Illustrates the use of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) with the most basic bootstrap template containing only two files:

  * index.html contains the page and loads a **Bootswatch* theme file (and other files) from CDNs.
  * style.css provides site-specific customizations.

The .project file provides an Eclipse project definition.
  
The page itself provides a responsive navbar with a small amount of body text.

README.md and the doc/ directory are for github documentation; you can delete them if you
have downloaded this as a zip file for use as a template.
